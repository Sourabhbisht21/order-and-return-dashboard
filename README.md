üìù Project Overview
The primary objective of this dashboard is to monitor and analyze the company's sales, profitability, and product returns over a specific period (August 2014 - April 2016). It aims to empower business stakeholders to make data-driven decisions by identifying trends, pinpointing areas of concern (like high return rates), and recognizing top-performing areas.

‚ú® Key Features & Insights
The dashboard is structured into several key analytical sections:

1. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
At-a-glance metrics provide a snapshot of the overall business health:

Total Profit: $109.98K

Total Sales: $874.87K

Total Returns: 109

Total Transactions: 1827

2. Year-over-Year (YoY) Performance
These cards focus specifically on the returns performance compared to goals and previous periods:

Avg. Return Value (YoY): The average value of a returned item is $377.75, which is -11.06\% below the target.

Return Rate % (YoY): The current return rate is $5.56\%, which is +8.33\% higher than the goal, indicating a potential area for concern.

Total Returns (YoY): The number of returns has increased by +50\% compared to the goal.

3. Trend Analysis
Monthly Return Trend vs. Last Year: The line chart visualizes the number of returns each month, comparing the current year against the prior year. A significant spike in returns is visible around December 2015.

4. Contribution Analysis
Profit by Segment: The "Consumer" segment is the most profitable, contributing $47.89\% of the total profit.

Sales by Region: The "East" region leads in sales with a $33.36\% share, while the "South" has the lowest contribution at $15.18\%.

Return Contribution by Employee: This section highlights that employee Anna is associated with a majority of returns ($56.68\%), which warrants further investigation into the products she handles or her sales processes.

5. Interactive Filtering
A Date Range Slider at the bottom allows users to dynamically filter the entire dashboard to analyze specific timeframes between 8/8/2014 and 4/16/2016.
